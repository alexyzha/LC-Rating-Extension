# LC-Rating-Extension
Uses data from https://github.com/zerotrac/leetcode_problem_rating to display ELO ratings for LeetCode problems. Works on the US version of the site, built for Chrome/Opera (Chromium).

# Installation Instructions (Opera, should be similar for Chrome):

## 7. Have fun LeetCoding! :D

P.S. All files in the **"data"** and **"tutorial"** folders as well as the **"README.md"** file can be freely deleted. Everything in **"icons"**, **content.js**, and **manifest.json** must be kept in order for the extension to work.
